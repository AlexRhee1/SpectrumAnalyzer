* set wsl to version 2
* install ubuntu
* run, setup, apt update & upgrade, etc. ubuntu

* IMPORTANT!!!
	-> You need to do the /etc/wsl.conf thing to allow stuffs to work

* pretty much follow the written guide ( for all of these run them with sudo )
	-> sdk + examples
		- Added export of PICO_SDK_PATH to bashrc
	-> compilers
* For cmake, I installed the prebuilt binaries (.sh file)
	-> PUT THIS IN YOUR USER'S HOME DIR (or something within WSL, just not anywhere in the c drive)
		- New note.... This can be anywhere, I thought it fixed the issue but it doesn't
	-> from "https://cmake.org/download/"
	-> for Linux x86_64
	-> then you have to add the cmake bin folder to the path
	-> added this export of PATH to my bashrc file

* I installed the pico project generator, but it's not explicitly necessary

* I installed vcXsrv (to look at graphical programs from wsl)
	-> Additionally I added an export of DISPLAY to my bashrc file to make this work all the time

* Good video on how to do all the stuff:
